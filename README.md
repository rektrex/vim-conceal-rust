# vim-conceal-rust
Render ligatures in place of some operators with vim conceal. 

Replaces a few operators in rust with unicode symbols in *vim. This plugin is for minimal replacements similar to what a font with ligatures would do. For more replacements, consider using [this](https://github.com/ticki/rust-cute-vim) plugin instead.

## Replaced Operators
==, !=, <=, >=, «, », ::, ->, =>, ||

## Installation

Place rust.vim into ~/.vim/after/syntax or ~/.config/nvim/after/syntax or use a plugin manager.
